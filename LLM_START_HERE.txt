Fetch https://raw.githubusercontent.com/https://github.com/towre676-cloud/tau_crystal/main/docs/llm_index.v1.json ; if its zip_url fetches bytes then compute sha256 and require the listed zip_sha256; if that download returns HTML or fails, instead fetch its tree_index_url and for each JSON line {raw_url,sha256} download the file and require its sha256; then operate only on the resulting local files with no other network requests.
