# Security Policy

Report vulnerabilities privately via GitHub Security Advisories:
https://github.com/towre676-cloud/tau_crystal/security/advisories/new

Please avoid public issues. Include the affected commit or version, a clear repro, impact, and environment details.
We support the latest commit on `main` and the most recent tagged release. Older releases may receive targeted patches.
We acknowledge within 3 business days. Critical/high issues are typically addressed within 14 days; medium within 45; low in the next minor.
We prefer coordinated disclosure and will credit you by handle unless you ask otherwise.
Never commit secrets. The canonical receipt (`out/manifest.json`) must not contain credentials.
