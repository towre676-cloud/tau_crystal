Determinant Line Receipts for Computational Bordisms: A Field-Theoretic Approach to Reproducibility

Abstract
We construct a field-theoretic framework for computational reproducibility in which program executions are bordisms, receipts are boundary states in determinant line bundles, and semantic drift is measured as curvature of a Quillen connection. The central objects are the τ-coordinate, defined as Berry-Quillen holonomy along the temporal circle of a run, and the residue R(M), given by the logarithmic derivative of a zeta-regularized determinant over the cochain complex of computational states. Nondeterminism enters geometrically as the curvature of a rank-one local system whose entropy two-form K governs stability tolerances. We show that attested equivalence between runs corresponds to triviality of monodromy in an isomorphism groupoid, that refactoring operations induce exact sequences in a witness cosheaf, and that the obstruction to global receipt choice is encoded by a Dixmier-Douady class in the spirit of anomaly cancellation for reflection-positive field theories. The resulting runtime system, τ-Crystal, produces cryptographically signed receipts carrying determinant-line data, spectral residues, and entropy witnesses that compose under disjoint union and are invariant under controlled deformations. This provides a mathematically rigorous foundation for what it means to say that two computations "agree" despite differing in implementation, randomness, or environment.
