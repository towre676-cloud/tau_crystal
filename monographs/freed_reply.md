# Executable Physical Mathematics: A τ‑Crystal Response to Freed (2024)

## Abstract

We present a runtime framework that implements — in diagnostic, self‑verifying form — the conceptual architecture proposed in Freed’s 2024 “Physical Mathematics.” Using τ‑Crystal, field‑theoretic structures are realized as observable emission chains; cohomological obstructions are tracked via spectral residues; and symmetry, anomalies, and invertibility are encoded as cryptographically signed runtime behaviors. Each section mirrors Freed’s structure and answers it with live implementations bound to receipts.

## 1. Physical Mathematics as Instrument
The instrument replaces static assertions with emission chains. Segment additivity, factorization, atlas swap, APS split, relative index, and monodromy become equality tests between independently emitted quantities, each preserved as a signed receipt in .tau_ledger/.

## 2. Symmetry, Anomaly, Defect Fusion
Anomalies are runtime residues recorded by APS boundary splits and fusion associator checks. Defect fusion tables are emitted and verified associatively with signed diagnostics.

## 3. BPS, Wall‑Crossing, Compactification
Chebyshev‑based entropy stacks register index jumps under moduli variation; tmf ΔlogB joiner records compactification mismatches as modular deviations.

## 4. Invertibility, η‑invariants, tmf
Segment additivity operationalizes invertibility. APS splits verify anomaly inflow. tmf‑level summaries measure modular failure classes as runtime signatures.

## 5. Quantum Gravity to Geometry and Arithmetic
Runtime diagnostics become mathematical data: Laurent residues, torsion indicators, and spectral curvature feed a ledger of reproducible invariants.

## 6. Interactions with Number Theory
Automorphic emitters test SL(2,ℤ) covariance on partition proxies; mock‑modular corrections are emitted from ∂̄ residues; Langlands proxies and attractor arithmetic are recorded with Merkle‑bound provenance.

## 7. Condensed Matter; 8. Low‑Dimensional Topology; 9. Geometrization; 10. Beyond the Paper
Berry curvature, twisted K‑theory for topological phases, knot and 3‑manifold proxies, SCFT singularity diagnostics, and optional BV/integrability emitters share the same receipt idiom and verification culture.

## Instrument Status (Corridor Program)
The corridor q‑leg is installed with a default‑to‑E₄ only when no plugin is present; σ‑orientation generator and PF/AGT/SW bridge receipts are stamped objects with stable schema, time, and provenance; the Lean capsules are compiling theorems hashed into receipts; Z4c rung promotes to nonlinear, resolution‑aware runs with guards that refuse endorsement on instability or wrong‑sign deltas.

## Standard of Evidence
Numbers, theorems, and receipts agree byte‑for‑byte. Toolchains are pinned; floating‑point knobs recorded; Python package locks emitted; Lean build Merkles tagged. Claims are bound to files any machine can re‑run and verify.
