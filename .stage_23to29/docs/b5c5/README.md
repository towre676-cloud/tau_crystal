# B5C5 Weyl Scaffold: Canonical α‑Bounded Mass Inference

This folder contains the canonical program, output, and metadata for the identification of a rank‑5 Weyl chamber (B₅ ≅ C₅, order 3840) governing sparse log‑monomial fits to Standard Model mass ratios under α‑bounded constraints.

- **B5C5.txt**: Formal derivation, symmetry explanation, full pipeline description.
- **b5c5_demo.py**: Auditable NumPy implementation of the sparse search with φ-gate, RG-likelihood, and Weyl canonicalization.
- **winners.tsv**: Top canonical exponent vectors for real PDG mass ratios.
- **logB.txt**: Calibrated Bayes factor confirming non-chance alignment of the inference with the Weyl symmetry scaffold.
- **manifest**: See `.tau_ledger/discovery/b5c5-20250920T223500Z.manifest` for hash‑bound registration and pipeline freezing parameters.
