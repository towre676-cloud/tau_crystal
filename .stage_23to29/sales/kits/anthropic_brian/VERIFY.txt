HOW TO VERIFY IN 30 SECONDS

1) Compute the fingerprint (SHA-256):
   sha256sum artifacts/your_bundle.zip

2) Compare to the expected fingerprint printed in ledger/receipt.json
   (field: expected_sha256). They must match character-for-character.

3) Verify the signature on the receipt with the pinned public key:
   openssl dgst -sha256 -verify ../../keys/public_key.pem -signature ledger/receipt.sig ledger/receipt.json
   # expect: Verified OK

If steps 1â€“3 pass, keep the file, receipt.json+receipt.sig, and affidavit.pdf together as your evidence set.
