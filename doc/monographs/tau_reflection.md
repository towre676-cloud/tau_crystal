# 🪞τ‑Reflection: Descent, Fixpoint, and Obstruction

τ‑Reflection is a recursive epistemic diagnostic framework that simulates descent towers through cosine iteration, evaluates their entropy behavior, and certifies convergence via spectral and residual witnesses. Each invocation yields a sealed knowledge capsule containing entropy traces, tail norms, fixpoint predicates, and hash-based cryptographic integrity.

## Descent Mechanism
Let τ₀ be any real starting value. We define a recursive sequence by:

\tτₖ = cos(τₖ₋₁)
