  "tier": 7,
  "statement_md": "A lightweight linear model on theory-guided features (autocorrelations, run statistics, low-frequency spectrum, modular profiles) achieves small generalization error for predicting $\\mathbf{H}_d^S(k)$ on synthetic periodic corpora; concretely, the mean absolute error on held-out data is $\\le 0.02$.",
  "assumptions_md": "Sequences are binary periodic fixtures drawn from a family with bounded period and varied densities; target is the global HEO $\\mathbf{H}=\\limsup_N \\frac{1}{N}\\sum_{n\\le N} X(n)$ which equals the period average.",
