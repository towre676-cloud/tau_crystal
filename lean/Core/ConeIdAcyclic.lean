Cone(id) acyclicity — portable statement bound to JSON witness.
Witness: artifacts/proofs/cone_id_gf2.json produced by scripts/echo/_cone_id_gf2_check.py
The statement is stable: you can later replace `True` with a concrete acyclicity proof
over your chosen chain model without changing module boundaries.
