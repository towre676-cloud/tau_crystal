# Corridor A‑4 — Season 1 (Cast‑to‑Solver Equivalence)

This capsule binds the classroom narrative to the exact solver state τ‑Crystal logs and certifies. Every prop is a variable; every scene beat is the computation that sets its value; the final on‑screen JSON is the receipt of the run. The hallway operator \(M\) is split \(M=\u03A0+R\) with centering \(\ell^\top R=0, Rr=0\), spectral radius \(\rho(R)=0.62\), and budget \(1-\rho=0.38\). Episode one measures `lambda_pf`, `rho_R`, `pf_gap_budget_hint`; episode two sets `precond`; episode three fixes `chebyshev_k`; episode four pins `solver='gmres'`, `iters`, `restarts`; episode five toggles `bf_trivial`, `kkt_ok`, `sos_certified`; episode six records `kn_mu_norm`; episode seven stamps domain size; episode eight adds `replay_ok` and `checksum`; episode nine declares `obstruction` and `early_exit`; episode ten freezes `atlas_pages` and `path_steps` as a human‑readable path to maximality. See cast.tsv for the one‑to‑one map.
