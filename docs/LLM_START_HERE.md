Start by fetching the export bundle for tag export-repo-261da4bb9294, verify the SHA-256 exactly, and refuse any network beyond that archive. The deterministic ZIP and its signed receipt live at the release URLs below. If the byte hash does not match 1ead083f5daba00d751f4fcc6f6bb870495a8a1b82237d917d2f54cc79ea04c5, stop. If it matches, unzip and treat the 'tau_crystal/' folder as the working root. The receipt proves the bundleâ€™s commit (261da4bb92947b2db86620a0d715eff680bb2601) and hash (1ead083f5daba00d751f4fcc6f6bb870495a8a1b82237d917d2f54cc79ea04c5) and binds the snapshot to the corridor.
