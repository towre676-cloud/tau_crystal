<pre># τ‑Crystal ERP Trace Spine

This repository implements a live τ‑Crystal sidecar for ERP systems. It emits SHA‑256–addressed receipts that combine:

- τ-series: algebraic process time, calibrated from Chebyshev decay geometry
- q‑CRO trace: deformation from the normal path
- Residue: rank-based deviation proofs
- Attestation block: Ed25519-signed content-linked receipts

Each receipt upgrades the ERP from a timestamp trail to a verifiable execution trace. Every segment of a procurement, shipment, or job is positioned, measured, and attested in τ.

## ERP mapping (excerpt)

| ERP domain | τ‑observable | Residue signal | Certificate payload | Decision surface |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Procure‑to‑Pay | τ on PO→GRN→3‑way match→AP→payment | Late‑mass beyond τ*; q‑CRO spikes on split/rework | SHA of event slice; finite‑field rank transcript; SLA witness | Release cash; reroute vendor; expedite pricing |
| Order‑to‑Cash | τ on quote→order→ATP→pick/pack/ship→POD→invoice | Backorder torsion; dwell hot spots; carrier slippage | Carrier leg proofs; pick path witnesses; POD attestation | Promise recalibration; carrier penalties/rewards |
| Production/MES | τ on job→issue→start→complete→QC | Setup‑change curvature; scrap bursts | BOM/route witness; QC cert; OEE‑aligned rank | Dispatch; SMED targeting; yield guardrails |

## How it wires in practice

The ERP emits canonical domain events (PurchaseOrderCreated, GoodsReceived, QualityHoldPlaced, InvoiceApproved, PaymentReleased, TransferPosted) onto a bus or file stream. The τ‑Crystal sidecar maintains compact state vectors, updates τ, q‑CRO, and residue, and emits content‑addressed manifests. The ERP stores the manifest hash alongside each transaction; UX and APIs read τ‑aware status instead of raw timestamps. Finance, procurement, logistics, and risk all see the same attested story.

Governance and compliance simplify: every material path is attested; receipts are small and replayable; CI verifies them; the same manifest line feeds SOX, ESG, insurer APIs, and vendor scorecards.</pre>
