# τ-Clock Axioms (Admissible Class)

An admissible τ is any runtime signal that witnesses progress as a monotone, reproducible ordering of a computation’s states. The axioms are intentionally small. Monotonicity requires that τ never decreases along the realized execution path when only benign rescheduling and reordering occur. Stability requires that τ be insensitive to scheduler noise, device jitter, and other perturbations that preserve semantic equivalence of the run; in practice we calibrate stability by replaying under small affinity and seed perturbations and demanding near-equality. Locality requires that τ depend only on state available to the run at the time of emission; offline oracle knowledge is forbidden. Subadditivity requires that concatenating two phases cannot inflate τ beyond the sum of their τ-lengths up to a fixed calibration constant. Any τ that demonstrably satisfies these, together with open evidence of its construction and parameters, is admissible. Spectral τ remains a first-class member when an operator truly encodes the computation’s shape; work-accounting τ is admissible when operator surrogates would be performative; an ensemble τ fuses multiple honest instruments by isotonic regression and fails loudly when they disagree. Receipts must disclose the τ class, its parameters, its provenance, and the micro-experiments that justify its selection so that auditors can reproduce the judgment.
