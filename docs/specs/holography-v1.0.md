# τ‑Crystal holography v1.0

Defines a tensor of build-state coordinates and stamps its sha256 into the manifest. Coordinates: chain_len, oleans, bytes_oleans, bytes_build, timefold_receipts, cache_density_per_mille. The tensor file is JSON; verification compares its sha256 with the manifest value.
