# τ‑Crystal Narrative — Chunk 12

Morphic Echo → produce U:C•(f₁)→C•(f₂), compute Cone(U), Betti b_k, graded ΔS; sheafify Cone across τ windows; publish Merkle siblings for H_*.
Čech Curvature → pick cover {U_i}, compute g_{ij} on overlaps, c_{ijk} on triples; publish ℓ(c), edit paths; verify δg=c and δc=1.
Motive Embedding → build variety from manifest params; compute per, reg, per_p; Lean binding lemma; log Galois action.
Sealing → choose finite full subcat 𝒟; form delta 𝓝; compute pushout 𝓜′; verifier replays pushout and reproduces H_τ exactly.
