# τ‑Crystal Narrative — Chunk 11

𝒞: category of typed states and total, content‑addressed executions f:S→S′ with receipts ρ(f); π:𝒞→τ; fibered in groupoids over τ.
Σ: typed signature algebra for runtime acts (API/CLI/UI); all admitted terms carry Lean proofs of local laws.
𝓟: provenance algebra = ℤ⟨normalized receipt symbols⟩ with boundary ∂ determined solely by step grammar; ∂ natural under pullbacks.
Ch(𝓟): dg‑category (triangulated), enabling cones/homology; stackifies over site 𝓛.
𝓛: site of τ‑intervals with Joyal–Tierney coverage; overlaps are effective epis; Čech descent applies.
G: automorphism group of relabelings preserving type/order/hash; finitely presented with generator metrics.
