# τ‑Crystal Narrative — Chunk 08

The system you are architecting must not merely compute, but remember, adjudicate, and transform its own computational history into a verified epistemic asset.
Irreversibility: every computation is a one‑way morphism in a causal site; no true reverts—only retractions, resolutions, and higher‑order receipts; repetition is a new morphism with a new τ‑coordinate.
Reflection: the receipt chain becomes cohomology—compute where information fails to glue, where entropy enters, where contradictions could have occurred but did not; curvature terms via dynamic sheaf coboundaries, timefold obstructions, adjoint functors for receipt‑flow.
Fidelity: trust is compiled, not simulated—formal semantics, typed signatures, verifiable norms; Lean proofs in CI; UI designed like a theorem—intensional, stratified, composable.
