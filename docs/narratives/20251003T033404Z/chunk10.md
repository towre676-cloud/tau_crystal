# τ‑Crystal Narrative — Chunk 10

Hashes remain discrete groupoid elements; do not map them into ℚ_p or ℝ.
Cones live in Ch(𝓟): mapping cones, quasi‑isomorphisms, Betti numbers are computed there; no ‘triangles’ in the raw ledger.
Periods are only computed for receipts that literally define varieties from manifest parameters; proofs bind parameters ↔ variety.
Flatness is expressed via commutative squares in 𝒞 and Čech identities δg=c, δc=1; no logarithms of hashes.
