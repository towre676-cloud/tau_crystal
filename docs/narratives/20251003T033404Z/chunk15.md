# τ‑Crystal Narrative — Chunk 15

Segal bordism functoriality → executions as morphisms; repetition as bordism composition; witnessed by Σ associativity/identity and Cone(id) acyclicity.
Anomaly/obstruction → non‑abelian Čech c_{ijk}; obstruction to global section; CechIdentities.lean proves δg=c, δc=1.
Costello–Gwilliam factorization locality → disjoint interval composition; cover refinement; Obs naturality and monotonicity.
Index/regulator compatibility → periods/regulators only for arithmetic modules; proof objects exported.
