# τ‑Crystal Narrative — Chunk 09

Repetition as derived functor: R₂ = ℱ(R₁) with ΔS captured as an associated‑graded observable rather than continuous Jacobians; new receipt hash h₂ = Hash256(h₁ ‖ τ₂ ‖ witness), stored as a differential receipt (no logs of hashes treated as numbers).
Curvature as non‑abelian Čech 2‑cocycle c_{ijk} = g_{ij} g_{jk} g_{ki}; anomaly ⇔ c_{ijk} ≠ e; publish edit‑length ℓ(c_{ijk}) in G.
Timefold: Θ involution; asymmetry via KL(μ_t ‖ μ_{−t}) with fixed priors and windowed measures.
Motive lift (eligible modules only): M_R ∈ Ext¹_{MTM}(ℚ(0),ℚ(1)); per(R), reg(R), per_p(R); bind to manifest parameters by Lean proof; record Galois descent.
Sealing as pushout: 𝓜′ = 𝓜 ⊔_{𝓜|_𝒟} 𝓝; replay in public verifier; Merkle root H_τ reproduced.
