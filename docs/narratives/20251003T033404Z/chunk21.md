# τ‑Crystal Narrative — Chunk 21

Substrate frozen → types compile; descent verified; iso groupoid emitted.
Cone works → H•(Cone(id))=0 proof passes; descent for cones; H_* Merkle siblings.
Echo measured → Betti ≥ 0; graded ΔS present; restriction logs; priors recorded.
Čech valid → δg=c and δc=1; ℓ(c) finite; finer cover descent; edit paths exported.
Motive honest → example passes; eligible only; Gal actions and variety replay.
Seal reproducible → H_τ matches; Kan descent; full Merkle tree JSON.
