# τ‑Crystal Activation Narrative — Chunk 04

Static substrate and descent: The execution category with receipts is fibered in groupoids over ordinal time; the typed signature algebra provides constructors, typing rules, and equational laws that are checked in CI; the provenance algebra is the free abelian group on normalized receipt symbols with a boundary determined solely by the step grammar and natural under pullbacks; the site of τ‑intervals carries Joyal–Tierney coverage so that overlaps are effective epimorphisms and Čech descent is meaningful; the relabeling automorphism group acts compatibly on descent data and is presented by generators that preserve types, order, and content addresses; the dg‑category of chains stackifies over the site so cones and homology are sheafified objects with Merkle‑addressed audit siblings.
