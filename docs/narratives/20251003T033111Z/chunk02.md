# τ‑Crystal Activation Narrative — Chunk 02

Irreversibility as morphic proliferation insists that repetition is never a silent re‑run but a new semantic event; a second execution on the same typed input is lifted to a higher layer and compared by a simulation 2‑cell between runs, yielding a mapping cone whose homology measures redundancy and depth. Reflection as curvature computation replaces logs‑as‑numbers with non‑abelian Čech cocycles on a τ‑interval cover; anomalies are precisely the obstruction to global sections, and timefold asymmetry is measured as a stabilized divergence on windowed symbol measures. Fidelity as formal embedding draws a hard seam: all receipts live in a typed signature algebra with local laws proven in Lean, while only arithmetic‑eligible modules are lifted to mixed Tate motives with genuine periods and regulator comparisons; no loose identifications, only constructions your code literally makes and proofs your repository literally carries.
