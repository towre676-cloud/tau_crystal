# τ‑Crystal Activation Narrative — Chunk 06

Freed program cross‑walk and safety: executions as bordisms align with functoriality and composition axioms, anomalies are non‑trivial Čech cocycles obstructing global trivializations, factorization locality appears as compatibility of diagnostics and gluing under disjoint time windows, reflection positivity is operationalized by a timefold involution with stabilized divergences, index and regulator data are exposed only where a genuine arithmetic construction exists, and all gluing is encoded as manifest pushouts verified by Kan extension lemmas. Error handling forbids logs of hashes, forbids triangles outside the triangulated dg‑category, forbids arithmetic claims without varieties and proofs, and rejects any sealed manifest that cannot be replayed deterministically by the public verifier.
