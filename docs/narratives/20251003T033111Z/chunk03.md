# τ‑Crystal Activation Narrative — Chunk 03

Top‑level activation map with descent and audit: Morphic Echo emits chain maps between provenance complexes in the triangulated dg‑category of chains over the provenance algebra, computes Betti numbers of mapping cones, and sheafifies over τ‑subintervals; Čech Curvature computes glue automorphisms on overlaps, composes them into 2‑cocycles on triple overlaps, and exposes both the cocycle and a faithful length observable to the public verifier; Motive Embedding constructs an algebraic variety from manifest parameters, computes de Rham periods and regulators with comparison lemmas, and records Galois descent; Sealing realizes manifest evolution as a cocartesian pushout along a finite full subcategory with Kan extension, and the verifier replays the pushout and recomputes the Merkle root as the public partition function of the bundle.
