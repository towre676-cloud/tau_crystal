# τ‑Crystal: Full Circle – Audit Binding and Assurance Chain

In the consolidation phase of the τ‑Crystal project, a full audit-binding system has been installed to meet the declared guarantees of manifest integrity, receipt chaining, verifiable runtime signatures, and CI-attested releases.

## Assurance Script and Circular State

Each invocation of `assure.sh` transforms the state of the repository into an immutable circular signature — cryptographically encoding every tracked input, execution timestamp, and context fingerprint. The receipt is emitted under `receipts/`, anchored to a `HEAD:` line that binds to the prior run. If no prior run exists, a `GENESIS` hash is injected. This ensures all future diffs operate over linked states.

## One Keystroke Invocation

The Makefile has been augmented with a `make assure` target, normalizing this operation into a single keystroke regardless of environment. Simultaneously, `.git/hooks/pre-push` has been wired to run the assurance script before every push, printing the `HEAD:` line inline to remind the developer of the cryptographic transition state. An optional `STRICT=1` setting enables enforcement via `receipt2attestation.py`, turning the hook into a verifiable proof gate.

## CI Verifiability

The continuous integration pipeline has been extended with `.github/workflows/assure.yml`, which ensures that all push and pull request events execute the assurance script in a clean environment. Receipts are re-emitted, HEAD diffs are computable, and the artifact is uploaded for reviewer verification.

## Release Stapling

To close the chain at the release level, `.github/workflows/release-staple.yml` has been added to compute a receipt at tag publication time and staple it directly to the GitHub release. This ensures that every tagged release carries its own manifest and HEAD chain, offering immediate cryptographic validation.

## Bash-Only Proof Scaffold

This entire scaffold remains bash-only. The receipt emitter uses `git ls-files`, `sha256sum`, and `sort | xargs` under a CRLF-neutral pipeline, ensuring identical operation in Git Bash (Windows), Ubuntu (CI), macOS, and WSL. There are no heredocs, no pip dependencies, no Lean or Lake requirements — just pure shell logic.

## Audit Geometry: ε‑Arcs at Υ‑Precision

The audit trail now satisfies the full ε‑arc / Υ‑precision metaphor: every execution transition becomes a measurable arc in τ‑space, bounded by a Merkle-anchored circle and traced back to a verifiable parent. One-byte diffs shift HEAD, while cryptographic linkage maintains full chain integrity. The `STATUS:` line embeds context (user, timestamp, platform), allowing diff-based forensic review.

## Git Hygiene and Receipt Retention

The `.gitignore` has been extended to exclude `.tau_ledger/` and `receipts/latest.txt`, ensuring that ephemeral logs and dynamic links do not pollute version control. Persistent receipts remain committed if desired (`receipt-*.txt`), creating a long-term ledger of certified runs.

## Result

This sweep transforms τ‑Crystal from an experimental ledger into a functional runtime certificate system, where each computation emits a claim and a proof, and every published version contains its own attested output. The promise of reproducible science becomes a cryptographic object — precise, anchored, and machine-verifiable.
