# τ‑Crystal: An Epistemic Ledger for LLM‑Mediated Discovery
## Toward Verified, Constraint‑Respecting Scientific Inference in the Age of Generative AI

### I. Hallucinated Insight, Overfit Truth
We live in an era where intelligence is cheap and explanation is expensive. Across domains touched by large language models, the supply of numerological clarity has exploded: ratios align, spectra fit, formulas seem to sing. Yet none of it carries what matters most—constraint traceability. The Texas Sharpshooter fallacy has gone digital. A model fires thousands of pattern‑seeking rounds at a blackboard of constants—fermion mass ratios, neutrino mixings, spectral lines—and then draws the bullseye around the tightest cluster. Absent a formal record of which priors were fixed, which dials were touched, and which hypotheses were admissible, such clarity collapses into mimicry. τ‑Crystal is the antidote. It transforms computation into a residue‑sealed epistemic transaction where the path to a claim is as sacred as the claim itself.

### II. Scientific Inference as Ledger
Before the transformer, inference carried a ritual: declare assumptions, derive consequences, present a derivation another mind could replay. Today the loop is opaque. A billion‑parameter model can mint hundreds of compelling candidate theories in a second. Which emerged from consistent priors? Which are artifacts of drift? Meaning requires observation of the epistemic path. A Koide‑style relation predicting a lepton mass is no more real than a lucky roll unless we can audit, replay, and re‑derive it from a fixed hypothesis lattice. τ‑Crystal reintroduces formality to informal inference: a runtime diagnostic protocol committing every hypothesis‑generating step to a verifiable ledger (Merkle‑rooted receipts, τ‑pulse, and cohomological residue). The product is not just a number; it is a replayable proof of discovery.

### III. The Anti‑Sharpshooter Contract
No theory is valid unless its discovery path is sealed at runtime, its priors locked before execution, and its dials invariant throughout the reasoning chain. Let 𝓕 be candidate hypotheses, 𝓗 the dial space, and 𝓑 ⊆ 𝓕×𝓗 the constrained prior manifold, committed ex ante. A τ‑run is τ = (𝓑₀, T, ℛ), where 𝓑₀ is the fixed prior lattice, T the transformation chain, and ℛ the runtime residue (signature of divergence/fidelity). A τ‑run is admissible only if T respects 𝓑₀ and ℛ remains within declared bounds. This is gauge‑fixing for knowledge.

### IV. BRST for LLMs: Gauge‑Fixing the Epistemic Drift
LLM pipelines often explore reparameterizations that look distinct but are epistemically the same, and may slip post‑hoc dial changes that create the illusion of depth. τ‑Crystal plays the role of a BRST operator: it kills epistemic ghosts by encoding the constraint lattice at the start and verifying the evolution chain step by step. Only gauge‑invariant discoveries survive; residues certify violations.

### V. The Runtime Residue Ledger
Embedded in a computation—Lean theorem search, LangChain agent, or HuggingFace loop—τ‑Crystal issues receipts that bind prior declarations, hypothesis steps, constraint fidelity, and a Merkle‑rooted manifest. Receipts are cryptographically enforced, CI‑verifiable, and replayable. A claim that cannot produce a valid manifest with residue in bounds is not a discovery; it is an artifact.

### VI. Case Study: Fermion Mass Hierarchies Under Constraint
The Standard Model’s mass spectrum tempts overfit discovery. Under τ‑Crystal, we commit a prior lattice—admissible constants, operations, function families—at t=0. The agent searches only within that lattice. Each variation is recorded; every improvement is attributable to an allowed transformation. Introduce an illicit dial—say, a late log π or a clandestine α‑dependence—and the residue spikes, the trace fails, the manifest is rejected. Fit quality without fidelity is demoted; transferability with fidelity is promoted. The burden of proof returns to the path, not the point.

### VII. Pipeline Interfaces: Lock, Trace, Seal
Minimal runtime hooks:
- `lock_dials`: declare constants, function classes, operations.
- `begin_trace`: start stepwise capture.
- `record_step(tool, input, output)`: bind calls/prompts/outputs.
- `compute_residue`: derive cohomological signals from the path.
- `commit`: seal a Merkle‑rooted manifest.
With these primitives, an agent that proposes a physical relation must show not only that it computes but that it computed under contract. τ‑Crystal does not limit discovery; it limits undocumented discovery.

### VIII. The Universal Discovery Ledger
End state: a time‑stamped, constraint‑locked, residue‑verified index of LLM‑assisted theories. Claims become provable transactions anchored by manifests. Communities cluster discoveries by residue class, verify prior fidelity, and replay derivations on demand. Publication yields to provable generation.

### IX. Closing
If DoltHub is GitHub for SQL, τ‑Crystal is the BRST operator for LLM discovery. By sealing each theory into a reproducible residue and proving it emerged from locked priors and non‑cheating dials, τ‑Crystal turns showmanship into scholarship.
