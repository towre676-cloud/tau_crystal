<pre># Ï„â€‘Crystal ERP Trace Spine

This repository implements a live Ï„â€‘Crystal sidecar for ERP systems. It emits SHAâ€‘256â€“addressed receipts that combine:

- Ï„-series: algebraic process time, calibrated from Chebyshev decay geometry
- qâ€‘CRO trace: deformation from the normal path
- Residue: rank-based deviation proofs
- Attestation block: Ed25519-signed content-linked receipts

Each receipt upgrades the ERP from a timestamp trail to a verifiable execution trace. Every segment of a procurement, shipment, or job is positioned, measured, and attested in Ï„.

## How it wires in practice

The ERP emits canonical domain events (PurchaseOrderCreated, GoodsReceived, QualityHoldPlaced, InvoiceApproved, PaymentReleased, TransferPosted) onto a bus or file stream. The Ï„â€‘Crystal sidecar maintains compact state vectors, updates Ï„, qâ€‘CRO, and residue, and emits contentâ€‘addressed manifests. The ERP stores the manifest hash alongside each transaction; UX and APIs read Ï„â€‘aware status instead of raw timestamps. Finance, procurement, logistics, and risk all see the same attested story.

Governance and compliance simplify: every material path is attested; receipts are small and replayable; CI verifies them; the same manifest line feeds SOX, ESG, insurer APIs, and vendor scorecards.
