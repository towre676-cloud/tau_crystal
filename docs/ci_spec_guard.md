# CI spec guard

This document describes the spec-guard workflow that turns the monograph into an executable contract. The guard verifies that the canonical test vector printed in the monograph hashes to the exact digest recorded in the text, that the latest chain-head line is a single LF-terminated record with a lowercase sixty-four hexadecimal digest followed by a single ASCII space and the relative path of the attested receipt, and that the receiptâ€™s reflective merkle root equals a manifest merkle root byte-for-byte. The repository includes a tiny builder that fabricates a demonstration manifest and receipt so that the workflow can run without external services. The guarantees are minimal and mechanical: canonicalization is byte-stable, hashing is SHA-256 over exact bytes, line endings are normalized to LF, and equality checks are plain string comparisons. When this workflow is green on main the repository is not only documented but self-attesting in the exact sense promised by the monograph.
