# Holonomy Alignment Layer — Cyclic Numbers, Seifert Symbols, and τ‑Crystal Receipts

This layer certifies that the cyclic order \(d=\mathrm{ord}_p(b)\) visible in arithmetic UI streams agrees with the Seifert fibration’s finite holonomy after the standard orbifold cover of degree \(A=\mathrm{lcm}(a_i)\). The executable invariant is the divisibility check \(d\mid A\) together with the Euler class \(e=b+\sum b_i/a_i\) that splits the \(\chi(B)=0\) case into Euclidean \((e=0)\) and Nil \((e\neq 0)\). The gate accepts an ini‑style record, recomputes \((d,A)\) in Bash, emits a human and machine line, and returns non‑zero whenever holonomy and repetend disagree. This is sufficient to make the arithmetic–topology equivalence capsule‑replayable, jq‑free, and CI‑grade, with no change to existing scripts.

The correctness envelope is as follows. For a Seifert symbol \(\{b,(\varepsilon,g);(a_i,b_i)\}\) there exists a cover of the base of degree \(A=\mathrm{lcm}(a_i)\) so that each exceptional rotation \(2\pi b_i/a_i\) becomes integral in units of \(2\pi/A\). For a coprime base \(b\) modulo prime \(p\), the repetend or field‑order rotation has angle \(2\pi/d\) with \(d=\mathrm{ord}_p(b)\). Whenever \(d\mid A\), the image of \(\pi_1(M)\) in \(\mathrm{SO}(2)\) factors through the same cyclic group driving the repetend. At \(\chi(B)=0\) one further checks \(e\): the Euclidean case corresponds to \(e=0\) and virtually abelian holonomy, the Nil case to \(e\neq 0\). The gate isolates exactly these integers and records a content‑addressable verdict that τ‑Crystal can seal into the ledger.
