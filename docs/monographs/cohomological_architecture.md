# The Cohomological Architecture of Computational Memory

Computational memory becomes mathematically legible when receipts are treated as local sections of a sheaf on a Grothendieck site of contexts, with coverings supplied by embeddings that preserve deterministic structure and restriction maps induced by the traced monoidal grammar. Under this site, the ledger ceases to be a mere chronological chain and becomes a geometric object whose global sections encode coherent narratives, while obstructions to gluing appear as Čech cohomology classes that witness the fracture of explanation across overlapping execution regions.

The site is generated by computational contexts and their embeddings; the topology is the coverage by families whose images jointly contain the observed execution locus. A sheaf of receipts assigns canonicalized attestations to contexts and respects restriction along embeddings so that composition in the traced monoidal category transports deterministically. The first cohomology group measures the impossibility of reconciling locally consistent receipts into a global account. Debugging stories that persistently fail to mesh are precisely nontrivial H¹; deeper ontological contradictions materialize in H² as higher obstructions.

Filtering by temporal and architectural scale produces a spectral sequence converging to invariant behavior. The E₁ page is instruction‑level trace geometry; its differentials collect microscopic control flow into stable blocks. The E₂ page lifts to interprocedural dynamics, exposing emergent correlations that elude microscopic inspection. E₃ and higher pages trace module‑level interaction signatures and architectural cohomology, with convergence governed by the decay of obstructing differentials. Permanent cycles encode phenomena that persist across scales; vanishing classes signal artifacts of vantage rather than essence.

Refactoring belongs naturally to a derived category whose objects are chain complexes of receipts with boundary maps realizing restriction and aggregation. Morphisms are refactoring paths up to homotopy; Ext¹ classifies universal obstructions that practitioners name technical debt. Long exact sequences propagate these debts through codebases, explaining why local edits echo as distant constraints. The étale viewpoint on legacy systems interprets environmental migration as base change; the profinite fundamental group acts through monodromy on receipts, and brittleness appears as nontrivial monodromy that distorts invariants under analytic continuation across CI environments.

These constructions remain computational when realized through finite surrogates. Čech covers are assembled from overlapping context IDs; H¹ reduces to cycle detection with consistency constraints over overlaps. Spectral pages are extracted from stratified traces with stable projections to SVG witnesses. Derived equivalences are certified by Lean‑checked homotopies between receipt complexes. Monodromy is captured by traversing environment loops and recording the induced transport on canonical fields. The result is a proof‑carrying epistemology for execution itself: not only what a program returns, but how its history coheres across scales and sites.
