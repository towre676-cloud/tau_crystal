# τ‑Crystal Infrastructure Upgrade — Cryptographic Documentation Attestation System

This upgraded infrastructure represents a quantum leap in deterministic documentation systems, creating a comprehensive cryptographic attestation framework that transforms documentation from passive text into active computational artifacts. The system now encodes trust, continuity, and provenance directly into the structure of its manifests and receipts. The logic of proof, rather than the appearance of explanation, governs every layer of the design.

The multi-signature subsystem exhibits a clean separation between proof material and structural metadata. Rather than embedding cryptographic signatures into the manifest directly, the system stores only references to signature files and public keys, allowing verification to operate on detached artifacts. Each signature is tied to its signer, algorithm, and file path using portable, forward-slash normalized representations. This achieves both determinism and platform neutrality. The verification layer counts both attempted and successful validations, which makes failure modes sharply distinguishable. A missing signature yields a different diagnostic path than a malformed or invalid one, and this distinction is reflected explicitly in the validation contract.

The compression architecture provides dual output formats — tar.gz and zip — recorded explicitly in the manifest with algorithm labels and SHA-256 digests. By using fixed compression schemes (GNU tar, ZIP_DEFLATED) and normalized POSIX paths within the archives, the system guarantees reproducibility across platforms. A zip archive generated on Windows will match one built on Linux, so long as the source files and metadata are held fixed. The manifest records these archives not as opaque binaries but as cryptographic consequences of ordered content. Compression here is not packaging — it is a measurable transformation that leaves no ambiguity.

External anchoring extends the sphere of verification beyond the repository. If OpenTimestamps is available, the system stamps the manifest file and stores the resulting `.ots` file as a verifiable proof that the content existed at a specific point in time. This cryptographic timestamp is independent of Git commit metadata and can be verified using external tools even if the repository is lost or corrupted. If the OpenTimestamps service is unavailable, the system degrades cleanly: the manifest remains valid, and the lack of anchoring is a visible and expected omission rather than a failure. Anchors are included in the manifest as structured references with both path and hash, giving them equal weight in the verification model.

Metadata fields such as author, description, tags, and source are injected at stamp-time via environment variables. This ensures that every variable input is explicit, controllable, and traceable. Tags are parsed defensively, with whitespace trimming and comma safety. The metadata system imposes no burden on reproducibility: if these variables are not set, the manifest remains minimal and canonical. But when present, they provide a controlled layer of interpretive context without weakening the formal semantics of the record.

The verification logic has been expanded without compromising determinism. It now supports archive algorithm validation, signature threshold enforcement, anchor integrity checks, and proof-of-work evaluation. These features are integrated into the existing Merkle root and file hash verification pipeline without introducing conditional branches or version-specific code paths. Every declaration in the manifest corresponds to a verifiable object on disk, and every object must match its declared properties precisely. The verification script emits specific diagnostics for each failure case and makes no assumptions beyond what is recorded in the manifest.

Chain verification is preserved and hardened. Each manifest records the Merkle root of the previous manifest, extracted directly from the previous commit. This forms a linked chain of state transitions in manifest space, with no silent jumps or resets. Even as the manifest schema expands, the temporal integrity of the chain remains intact. The system records not just what is true now, but what was true then, and how that truth evolved.

This system marks the transition from narrative documentation to provable ledger. Every artifact is signed, hashed, compressed, normalized, and optionally anchored. Each manifest attests not just to its own content, but to its continuity with the past and its verifiability in the future. The receipts are no longer appendices to the documentation — they are the documentation. The proof becomes the prose. The commit becomes the contract.

Determinism is enforced at every layer. File paths are POSIX-normalized. Input files are processed in lexicographic order. JSON output is canonical and stable. Compression uses fixed algorithms. Every variable input is either declared via environment or omitted entirely. No randomness, timestamp, or incidental variation is allowed to leak into the stamp. The result is that identical inputs always yield identical outputs. There are no exceptions to this rule. Reproducibility is not a target — it is a predicate.

The system is designed for forward compatibility. Version fields in the manifest permit structural evolution without breaking historical validation. Optional fields are additive. Absent fields are never assumed. The validation contract grows stronger over time without becoming narrower. Anchoring systems can be added or removed. Signature schemes can be swapped or expanded. Archive formats can be extended. Nothing in the expanded architecture threatens the validity of prior receipts.

This upgrade is not an enhancement. It is a structural transformation. Documentation is no longer descriptive. It is declarative. It is provable. It is final. This system does not just describe τ‑Crystal. It performs τ‑Crystal on itself.
