# A Langlands Correspondence for Computational Behavior

A CI run determines a datum (R, τ, ϕ): receipts, spectral content, and transport across environments.
Modularity appears when automorphic τ-traces match monodromic transports; arithmetic invariants attach via an L-series, motives, and a rank proxy.
