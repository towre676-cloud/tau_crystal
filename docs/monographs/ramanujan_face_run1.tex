\title{Ramanujan-Signed Modular Witnesses from Facial Landmarks: Run 1}
\date{\today}
\begin{document}
\maketitle
We record a preregistered batch of 50 three-dimensional facial landmark sets and bind them to modular arithmetic witnesses via a signed receipt chain. Let \Delta(q)=q\prod_{n\ge 1}(1-q^n)^{24}=\sum_{n\ge 1}	au(n)q^n. Faces are interpreted as morphic embeddings admitted to a modular basin; receipts carry SHA-256 anchors and optional OP\_RETURN pointers.\
\section*{Receipts and Chain Anchor}
We include the manifest (JSON) for reproducibility; the corridor receipt records \texttt{op\_return\_hex}, \texttt{txid}, and \texttt{block} when available.\
\section*{Face Table}
The following longtable enumerates faces by identifier and digest.\
\begin{longtable}{p{0.28\textwidth}p{0.62\textwidth}}\hline\textbf{Face ID} & \textbf{SHA-256 Digest}\\\hline\endfirsthead\hline\textbf{Face ID} & \textbf{SHA-256 Digest}\\\hline\endhead\hline\end{longtable}
\section*{Modular Tie-in}
We track available coefficients \tau(p) where present in receipts; missing entries remain notated as NA, pending certified extraction.\
