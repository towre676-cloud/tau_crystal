# The Canonical Chamber: A Response to *A Panorama of Physical Mathematics*

## Appendix C — On the Shift from Approximate to Exact Symmetry

What struck us most, in the transition from exploratory modeling to formal instrumentation, was not a change in numerical output, but a categorical shift in the *type* of structure we were invoking. In the original statistical work surrounding B5-symmetric mass ratios, the 3840-fold degeneracy was handled as a post-hoc symmetry cleanup: once the sampling was done, the orbit was collapsed, the representative selected, and the result quoted in canonical order. The Weyl group was a descriptive aid. It arrived after the inference.

That asymmetry is now reversed.

In the system we have built—centered on a single closed-form RG identity—

\[ I(\mu,\ell) = \mu^{-1} + b\ell = \mu_0^{-1}, \]

—the Weyl symmetry is no longer emergent. It is imposed *a priori* by the structure of the conserved integral. The map \(\mu(\ell)\) generated by this equation defines a leaf of the RG manifold, and the same integral used to compute \(\mu(\ell)\) is used to define the covariance \(\Sigma\). The whitening transformation \(W = \Sigma^{-1/2}\), constructed as the Gramian of logarithmic sections over the leaf, inherits the algebraic structure of that period integral. And because the integral is algebraic, the symmetries of the leaf are exact. The orthogonality group of the quadratic form is no longer approximately B5—it *is* B5.

This is a qualitative change. The inference step is no longer a map from data to coordinates *followed by* symmetry reduction. The affine RG leaf *is* the coordinate system, and the chamber structure is embedded in its geometry from the outset. The only degree of freedom left to the statistician is to choose a chamber index—not to shape the chamber, nor to infer its boundaries. The statistical claim therefore acquires the hardness of a geometric theorem: either the observed vector \(c\) lands in the canonical chamber, or it does not. The log-B is no longer a score but a signed volume ratio, computed in a space whose symmetry is exact, not assumed.

In this reading, the RG equation becomes an *instrumental gauge*—a frame whose flatness renders symmetry exact. But unlike conventional gauge choices, the frame is frozen by a cryptographic hash, not by analytic convention. The full whitening, residue, and inference geometry is reproducible from the tuple \((b,\mu_0,n,c)\), and any deviation from symmetry is detectable as a hash mismatch. This elevates the role of falsifiability: it becomes a matter not of hypothesis testing but of structural deviation.

The whitening process itself reveals the extent of this transformation. The covariance \(\Sigma\) is no longer a sampled object. It is the Gramian of log-ratio sections evaluated on the RG leaf. The inversion symmetry of the leaf maps to sign flips in log-ratios, and the axis permutation symmetry maps to label-independence under the integral. The result is that the Weyl group W(B5) acts orthogonally on the whitened \(\rho\)-space by construction, not approximation. The fundamental chamber—defined by ordered absolute \(|\rho_i|\) and a positive leading sign—is a fixed conical region bounded by hyperplanes orthogonal to the leaf’s direction. It is not selected by the analyst. It is dictated by the geometry.

The sparse rational vector \(r\), originally a free parameter in \(\mathbb{Q}^5\) with penalty terms (\(\ell_0\) norm, denominator complexity, \(\varphi\)-activation), is now a projection of the observed \(c\) onto that chamber. The penalties become geodesic regulators, penalizing curvature away from the leaf. The minimizer \(r^* = \Sigma^{-1} c\) is then the best-fitting point in the chamber under the whitening metric, and the residual log-B becomes a literal measure of how tightly the data land in the chamber, not a proxy for fit quality.

Even under deformation—e.g., a two-loop RG equation with

\[ \ell = -\frac{1}{b\mu} + \frac{b_1}{b^2}\log\left(\frac{b + b_1\mu}{\mu}\right) + C, \]

—the structure persists. Newton's method converges quadratically, and the eigenstructure of the leaf remains analytically traceable. The chamber is preserved to leading order, and the higher moments tilt gently, encoding the deformation into the curvature without violating symmetry. The result is an enriched chamber structure, compatible with larger Weyl embeddings (e.g., affine E6) but still governed by the original invariants.

To summarize: the RG identity \(I(\mu,\ell)\) no longer describes a model. It defines a *space*—one in which symmetry is enforced, inference is projection, and falsifiability is a structural mismatch. The τ‑Crystal program that houses this construction emits signed receipts for each step: the integral is solved, the sections recorded, the whitening computed, the projection done, and the chamber index confirmed. These receipts are hashed, stored, and replayable. The symmetry is not inferred—it is certified.

This is not a numerical artifact. It is a geometric law.

And that is what we believe your program—*A Panorama of Physical Mathematics*—has called for: not just structure in theory, but *structure under execution*. We built τ‑Crystal to answer that call.
