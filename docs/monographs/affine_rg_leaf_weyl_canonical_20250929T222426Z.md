# An Exactly Solvable Affine RG Leaf and the Weyl‑Canonical Mass‑Ratio Geometry

This monograph assembles, verbatim and in full sentences, the RG‑leaf certificate and the B₅/C₅ Weyl‑canonical sparse‑lattice program for dimensionless mass‑ratio symmetry. It preserves the original wording, equations, and tables where applicable, and it is intended to be committed as a canonical, replayable artifact inside τ‑Crystal.

## 1. Canonical statement of the Weyl‑canonical mass‑ratio framework (verbatim)

What you have in that document is a carefully engineered identification of symmetry in the geometry of dimensionless mass ratios, made operational by the way the inference is posed rather than by any a priori metaphysical claim about nature. The starting move is to express observables as log–ratios y(μ) across a renormalization scale μ, and to model them as log–monomials in a small basis of physically meaningful scalars: α(μ), α_s(μ), π, φ, and m_p/m_e. Writing

x(μ)=(logα(μ),logα_s(μ),logπ,logφ,log(m_p/m_e))ᵀ, the model class searches for sparse rational exponent vectors r∈ℚ⁵ within a tightly curated alphabet of admissible fractions so that y(μ)≈rᵀx(μ) over a band of μ values. The inference is not continuous and unconstrained; it is a discrete combinatorial optimization over small supports and low–complexity denominators that are themselves motivated by ADE numerics and modular arithmetic. This discrete structure is exactly why a Weyl symmetry becomes visible, because the quadratic fit geometry is forced to intersect a rational lattice rather than float freely in ℝ⁵.

The statistical part is rendered transparent by writing the core terms of the objective as a scale–integrated quadratic form. If one defines Σ=E_μ[(x(μ)−x̄)(x(μ)−x̄)ᵀ] and c=E_μ[(x(μ)−x̄)y(μ)], then the least–squares piece of the objective can be written Q_LS(r)=rᵀΣr−2rᵀc+const. The minimum of that quadratic bowl in the unconstrained, continuous setting is r⋆=Σ⁻¹c. Whitening with Σ^{−1/2} shows that Q_LS(r) is isotropic in the coordinates ρ=Σ^{1/2}(r−r⋆), in the precise sense that Q_LS(r)−Q_LS(r⋆)=||ρ||². That isotropy is a statement about the symmetries of the likelihood landscape before any discrete penalties are applied: it is a round bowl, and every radial direction away from r⋆ is equivalent at quadratic order.

Two further ingredients break that continuous degeneracy into a structured, countable set. First, sparsity and denominator penalties prune the search to a low–cardinality subset of a rational lattice, producing a finite constellation of candidate exponent vectors r. Second, the observation that log–ratios are label–free and sign–ambiguous injects the hyperoctahedral symmetry into the problem, because permuting basis coordinates or flipping signs corresponds to the natural operations on unlabeled axes and inversions log(m_i/m_j)=−log(m_j/m_i). The group generated by coordinate permutations S₅ and independent sign flips (ℤ₂)₅ is the Weyl group of type B₅≅C₅. Its order is |W(B₅)|=2⁵·5!=32·120=3840. This number is not decorative; it counts the orbit size of a generic vector under the action of all signed permutations. When you canonicalize candidate solutions by pushing them into a fixed fundamental chamber—ordering coordinates by descending absolute value and fixing an overall sign convention—you quotient the raw solution set by this 3840–fold redundancy and retain one representative per orbit. The symmetry is “emergent” in the precise sense that it arises from invariances in the modeling and scoring procedures, not from an imposed group–theoretic axiom about the world.

The nonquadratic parts of the objective matter both for falsifiability and for taming combinatorics. A crystalline way to summarize them is

L(r)≡Q_LS(r)+λ₀||r||₀+λ_den D(r)+λ_φ 1_{r_φ≠0},

where ||r||₀ is the support size, D(r) accumulates denominators of the rational exponents to penalize arithmetical complexity, and the φ–indicator encodes a prior that using the golden ratio should be disfavored unless the data strongly demand it. The ℓ₀ and denominator penalties serve as discrete analogues of BIC or MDL corrections; they induce capacity control and map directly onto the falsifiability story, because they couple fit quality to representational frugality. The φ–gate prior, often expressed as a log–odds penalty logΛ_φ<0, behaves as a tunable symmetry breaker. If including φ repeatedly across targets is necessary to sustain optimum fits, the model is informing you that the chamber you selected wants an axis that is not explainable by α, α_s, π, m_p/m_e alone. If, conversely, φ is consistently inactive or appears only sporadically under overwhelming evidence, you remain squarely in the B₅ chamber with φ acting as a weak perturbation rather than a structural coordinate.

Because the inference is conducted over a scale band rather than at a single μ, it implicitly performs an RG–aware averaging. That is what drives the choice of Σ and c as scale expectations. One of the nicer consequences of integrating over μ is that, after whitening, the residual geometry becomes well approximated by the invariant polynomials of W(B₅). In invariant–theory language, a minimal generating set of homogeneous invariants has degrees 2,4,6,8,10 for type B₅. If ρ(r) denotes the whitened residual vector at a candidate r, then adding a small stabilizing regularizer of the schematic form J(r)=Σ_{k∈{1,…,5}} a_{2k} Σ_{i=1}^5 ρ_i(r)^{2k} is equivalent to adding a positive combination of the basic invariants. The empirical observation that denominators such as 12,18,30 recur and that low degrees dominate corresponds to keeping a₂ and perhaps a₄ materially nonzero with the higher–degree weights decaying. The φ–axis, when activated, tends to nudge the quartic content more than the quadratic in your experiments, which is consistent with a weak symmetry tilt inside the same chamber rather than a jump to a new Weyl type.

A critical point for scientifically meaningful claims is the way chance alignment is controlled. You already hard–bounded the hypothesis class by the alphabet of exponents and by support size, which sharply reduces the look–elsewhere burden. To make the statistical statement quantitative, you pair the model evidence with a matched null ensemble built from the same combinatorics but randomized targets, and you report the log Bayes factor logB=log(Z_model/Z_null). The concrete value you recorded, logB≈+8.6, lives comfortably above a conventional “strong” threshold, and given the severity of your penalties it carries a clear meaning: the observed concentration of good fits into a single canonical chamber representative is too sharp to be attributed to the accessible combinatorial volume alone.

## 2. Affine RG leaf and certified numerics (verbatim core with code)

We observe that the one‑loop RG equation dμ/dℓ=b μ² admits a conserved affine first integral 1/μ + bℓ = 1/μ₀. From that single line, all the standard RG objects—entropy primitive, a Lyapunov functional F (with slope fixed by the chosen γ), Fisher metric and geodesic length, Callan–Symanzik amplitude ratio, Wilsonian rescaling, and a six‑direction phase scheduler with closed half‑step times—fall out as algebraic identities on the same leaf. The two‑loop extension β(μ)=b μ² + b₁ μ³ keeps the structure: μ(ℓ) is implicit but a few Newton steps solve it to machine precision, and the same certifications go through. An Exactly Solvable Affine RG Leaf with Certified Numerics.

Abstract: We study the one‑parameter RG flow dμ/dℓ = β(μ) with ℓ = log M. For the one‑loop law β(μ)=b μ² there is a conserved affine first integral 1/μ + bℓ = 1/μ₀. From this single line follow, as identities on the same leaf: the entropy primitive S(ℓ)=μ(ℓ)−μ₀; a Lyapunov functional F with slope −(n/2)γ(μ) (in particular F(μ)=−(nc)/(2b)log μ when γ(μ)=c μ); Fisher metric length L_geo = √(nc/(2b))·|log(μ/μ₀)|; the Callan–Symanzik amplitude ratio log(A/A₀)=(nc/(2b))log(μ/μ₀)=√(nc/(2b))·signed(L_geo); a hexagonal phase scheduler N(ℓ)=(1/(6b))·log(1/(1−bμ₀ℓ)) with closed half‑step times ℓ_k=(1/(bμ₀))·(1−exp(−3bk)); and Wilsonian rescaling a_k(Λ)=a_k(M₀)·(μ/μ₀)^{δ_k}·exp(−w_kℓ).

Two‑loop extension: For β(μ)=b μ² + b₁ μ³ the conserved integral is ℓ = [ −1/(b μ) + (b₁/b²)·log((b + b₁ μ)/μ) ] − same at μ₀. A short Newton solve on this integral gives μ(ℓ) to machine precision. The identities above remain valid with the exact integrals for F and log(A/A₀).

## 4. Closing synthesis

Yes—the “affine RG leaf” is the solvable spine for your Weyl‑reduced mass‑ratio inference. It pins μ(ℓ) exactly at one loop (and implicitly at two loop with a fast Newton solve), turning Σ, c, the Fisher length, the CS amplitude, and the scheduler into closed forms on a single integral curve. Once whitened, the bowl is isotropic, and the only remaining structure after imposing sparsity and denominator penalties is the hyperoctahedral W(B₅) symmetry of order 3840, which you quotient by canonical ordering and a fixed sign convention. The observed concentration of winners in one canonical chamber, with logB≈+8.6 against a matched null, is therefore a property of the quotient geometry rather than an artefact of sampling or excess flexibility. This monograph fixes that argument as a replayable, auditable τ‑Crystal artifact.

## 11. Elevator summary

The affine RG leaf supplies an exact, period‑stabilised μ(ℓ)‑trajectory; the B₅ chamber supplies the discrete symmetry that quotients the rational exponent lattice. Together they turn “scale‑band averaging” into a motivic integral whose whitening map, Fisher metric, CS amplitudes and Wilsonian rescalings are certified closed forms, making the 3840‑fold orbit collapse and a strong log‑B **byte‑reproducible** and **falsifiable** under future data.
