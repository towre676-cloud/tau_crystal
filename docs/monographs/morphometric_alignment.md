# τ‑Crystal Morphometric Alignment: LS3D‑W Ingestion, FAN Stubs, and τ‑Delta Receipts\n
The alignment program begins by transforming LS3D‑W into a ledger‑addressable object. The ingest script normalizes each face into a canonical 68‑point field, computes the tight bounding box and interocular baseline, and records a pose bin when yaw is known. The index, committed as a TSV with stable headers, becomes the sole source of truth for subsequent computation: every experiment cites a row in this index and binds its outputs to the index hash. This flips the usual training‑first posture on its head. Rather than trusting annotations outright, the program trusts only those annotations it can compute from repeatable input paths and record under a hash. The index is therefore a morphometric sheaf over the repository: sections are per‑face landmark arrays, restrictions are bounding‑box orbits under resolution changes, and gluing is the deterministic concatenation of pose‑binned slices.\n
The model scaffold is purposefully minimal. A two‑stage HourGlass with hierarchical parallel multi‑scale blocks reconstructs the classical coarse‑to‑fine structure while retaining a small parameter footprint and a transparent data path. The objective is not to chase leaderboard decimals but to give τ‑Crystal a faithful source of heatmaps with which to compute attestation signals. Heatmaps are preferable to direct coordinate regression because the residual between a predicted distribution and the canonical Gaussian stamp centered on a landmark can be treated as a bona fide object in the residue complex. By pushing residual energy forward across HourGlass depth, the system recovers a harmonic trace of alignment difficulty that can be compared across identities, poses, and resolutions without resorting to brittle thresholds.\n
Runtime attestation is defined by the τ‑delta encoder. The predicted heatmaps are converted into landmark coordinates by soft‑argmax, not argmax, because the latter discards uncertainty and ruins the information content of the residual. Once coordinates are available, the program computes the normalized mean error using the square root of the ground truth bounding‑box area as the scale. This enforces a geometry that treats faces as two‑dimensional fields subject to dilation rather than as isolated features. At the same time the encoder constructs a residual heatmap by subtracting the canonical Gaussian stamps from the predicted distributions, then integrates the absolute magnitude into a single energy. The pair consisting of the NME under bounding‑box normalization and the residual energy comprises the minimal attestation signature for a given face. Signatures are emitted as JSON and filed under a τ receipt in the ledger alongside the index hash and timestamp so the computation can be replayed byte‑for‑byte.\n
The epistemic posture is conservative. Labels are not ground truth; they are proposals. The ledger records where the network agrees with the proposal and, more importantly, where it does not, with deviations structured by pose buckets and resolution sweeps. The same image can be downsampled deterministically to collapse performance to a documented floor, producing a persistence diagram of alignment competence as scale declines. The soft‑argmax coordinates induce a differentiable path from the network to the τ‑delta metrics, which in turn allows the proof layer to certify that the numerical map from inputs to receipts is deterministic modulo floating‑point model. The only degrees of freedom that remain outside the certification boundary are architectural and stochastic initial conditions, both of which are bound by seeded initializers and recorded versions.\n
This pipeline is intentionally compatible with standard training regimes, but it is not hostage to them. The ingest and index live independently of any particular weight file. The FAN scaffold is small enough to train quickly while exposing all the tensor strata necessary to compute harmonic residual traces. The τ‑delta encoder provides a scale‑free, pose‑aware metric whose structure can be elevated to a cohomological invariant in the residue complex. In this way, the alignment problem is not merely solved in the predictive sense; it is reframed as an attestation problem where every claim is accompanied by a compact, cryptographically addressed witness that can be recomputed in perpetuity.
