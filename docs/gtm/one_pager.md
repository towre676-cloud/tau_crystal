# τ-Crystal Integrity — One Page

τ-Crystal turns any workflow into a tamper-evident chain of receipts and a manifest with a single Merkle root. The effect is blockchain-grade assurance without running a blockchain. Acquisition is commit-pinned, execution is receipt-emitting, verification is offline and deterministic. Auditors get evidence, engineers keep velocity, and researchers get reproduction that survives time and migration.

| Capability | What it does | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| Commit-pinned acquisition | Fetches bytes by content and commit, not by moving branch names | Eliminates UI scraping and drifting references |
| Receipt chain | Records utc, command, environment hash, output hash, and paths in a chained log | Makes the first divergent step immediately findable |
| Merkle manifest | Captures the whole tree in a single root | Lets you prove state succinctly and locally |
| Offline verification | Replays proof without network access | Works in air-gapped and regulated environments |

Commercial fit is strongest in compliance and audit services, research reproducibility, and software supply chain integrity. Packaging can be a fixed-fee pilot and an annual license or a metered SaaS per team, depending on deployment. The guiding principle is to charge for reduced time-to-evidence and lowered residual risk, not for seats.
