# Langlands under Instrumentation (Metrological Pipeline)

**No new arithmetic claims.** This repository presents a *measurement instrument*:
a deterministic, receipt-bound pipeline that maps canonicalized 3‑D biological measurements
to rational invariants, then to points in the classical moduli space \(\mathcal{M}_{1,1}(\mathbb{Q})\)
(elliptic curves over \(\mathbb{Q}\)), and finally to *standard* arithmetic invariants
\((a_p, N, \text{local types})\). All arithmetic objects are classical; the novelty is
**empirical access** to their distributions with cryptographic provenance.

**Random variable:**  
\(X:\{\text{faces}\}\to \mathcal{M}_{1,1}(\mathbb{Q})\), calibrated and receipt‑bound.

**Questions enabled (experimental number theory):**
- Empirical Sato–Tate on the *biometrically reachable* locus
- Conductor and \(j\)-height distributions under pushforward
- Isogeny collision rates induced by the canonical map
- Cross‑subject independence of \((a_p)\) sequences after conditioning

**Discipline (§5):** integrality, multiplicativity, Ramanujan bounds, stability.  
If any fails, results are discarded and the attempt is logged.

This is **scientific instrumentation**, not a new reciprocity law.
