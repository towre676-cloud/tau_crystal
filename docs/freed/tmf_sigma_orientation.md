# σ‑Orientation, tmf, and the q‑Leg of R_arith

The q‑leg of a map into R_arith determines a family of modular forms refined by the σ‑orientation. The receipts inherit multiplicativity from σ and assemble into a tmf‑valued invariant that is stable under prime change via ϕ_{p→p′}. The bridge adapters certify that the same ribbon section produces compatible modular data across PF, AGT, and SW slices.

**Emission plan (20251001T021208Z):** `scripts/freed/run_tmf_sigma.sh` emits \(q\)–expansion CSV (E4 stub) and a σ‑orientation receipt, to be replaced by corridor‑driven \(q\)–leg.
