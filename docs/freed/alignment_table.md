# Freed Panorama ↔ τ‑Crystal Corridor: Alignment Table

| Panorama motif (Freed) | τ‑Crystal construction in condensed ∞‑topos |
|---|---|
| Relative/Invertible QFT and anomaly lines | Receipt line in Pic with anomaly 1‑form ω; trivialization by flat section T_mot with Φ\*ω = d log T_mot on each bridge |
| Functorial field theory, locality, descent | Symmetric monoidal corridor functor with Čech descent; equal‑overlap projection realizes Čech H^1=0 and yields global section σ |
| Defects, factorization, gluing | Three‑patch cover with explicit restrictions and triple‑overlap checks; fusion realized as cocycle equations |
| Comparison functors (Hodge/CFT/SW) | Φ_PF, Φ_AGT, Φ_SW carry the same flat connection; gauge‑flatness verified by pullback equalities rather than assertion |
| Elliptic cohomology and tmf | σ‑orientation supplies modular forms parametrized by the q‑leg of R_arith; multiplicativity visible at receipt level |
| Quantization vs computation | Z4c/BSSNOK harness shows descent exactness suppresses constraint‑violating modes; locality becomes an empirical invariant |
