# Anomaly Line and Trivialization by d log T_mot

The anomaly line is an object of Pic equipped with a flat connection ω. Inside the condensed setting we exhibit T_mot so that d log T_mot = ω. For each comparison morphism Φ in {Φ_PF, Φ_AGT, Φ_SW} we verify Φ^*ω = d log(Φ^*T_mot), hence the anomaly trivializes functorially. This equality is checked in coordinates by the already‑running adapters, and recorded as receipts.
