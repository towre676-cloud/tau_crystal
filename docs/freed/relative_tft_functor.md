# Relative TFT Packaging of the Corridor

We package the corridor as a symmetric monoidal functor F_rel internal to the condensed ∞‑topos. Objects are the sites U_Cor, U_NR, U_Urb and their defect walls. Values are receipt lines in Pic. Locality is enforced by Čech descent with equal‑overlap projection realizing vanishing Čech H^1 and producing a global section σ. Monoidality is shown on generators and extended by coherence. The operative equation is Φ^*ω = d log T_mot across each comparison chart, ensuring the relative anomaly class dies after pullback.

**Proof work plan (20251001T021208Z):** corridor functor object `FRel` declared; monoidal laws and Čech \(H^1=0\) slated for Lean proof `CechH1_vanish`. Receipts to reference Lean hashes on completion.
