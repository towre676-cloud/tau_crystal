# Freed Alignment Layer

This directory contains the referee‑grade alignment of the τ‑Crystal corridor with Freed's Panorama. The alignment table summarizes correspondences. Three companion notes record the precise statements to be verified by code receipts: relative TFT packaging, anomaly trivialization, and σ‑orientation into tmf.
